AyurWell: Okay, I'm sorry to hear you have a headache. According to Ayurveda, headaches can be classified into Vata, Pitta, and Kapha types. Here's some information that might help you figure out what kind of headache you have and what you can do:

**Vata-type headache:**
*   **Causes:** Fear, anxiety, stress, nervousness, constipation, and physical overactivity. Dehydration can also be a factor.
*   **Remedies:**
    *   **Hydration:** If dehydration is suspected, drink homemade dextrosaline (1 tbsp sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 10 drops lime juice in a pint of water).
    *   **Soothing Paste:** Apply a paste of nutmeg powder and water to your forehead for about half an hour.
    *   **Vata-Balancing Diet:** Follow a diet that helps to keep Vata under control.

**Pitta-type headache:**
*   **Aggravating factors:** Working in the sun without head protection.
*   **Remedies:**
    *   **Sweet food:** Eat something sweet, like fruit or ice cream.
    *   **Nighttime Minimassage:** Before bed, rub bhringaraj oil or brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and scalp.
    *   **Cover your head:** Protect yourself from the sun.

**Kapha-type headache:**
*   **Characteristics:** Occurs in winter or spring, strikes in the morning or evening, and worsens when bending down. Often associated with sinus congestion, a clogged nose, a cold, or a cough.

To give you more specific advice, could you tell me:

*   What time of year is it?
*   What time of day did the headache start?
*   Does bending over make it worse?
*   Do you have any sinus congestion or a cold?
*   Have you been under a lot of stress or feeling anxious lately?
*   Have you been constipated?
*   Have you been getting enough water?

In the meantime, try to relax in a quiet, dark room.

AyurWell: Okay, I understand you're still experiencing a headache. Let's explore some potential Ayurvedic remedies. Based on Ayurvedic principles, headaches can be classified into Vata, Pitta, and Kapha types, each requiring different approaches.

**Here's a recap of potential remedies based on the type of headache:**

**Vata-type headache:**

*   **Causes:** Fear, anxiety, stress, nervousness, constipation, and physical overactivity. Dehydration can also be a factor.
*   **Remedies:**
    *   **Hydration:** If dehydration is suspected, drink homemade dextrosaline (1 tbsp sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 10 drops lime juice in a pint of water).
    *   **Soothing Paste:** Apply a paste of nutmeg powder and water to your forehead for about half an hour.
    *   **Vata-Balancing Diet:** Follow a diet that helps to keep Vata under control.

**Pitta-type headache:**

*   **Aggravating factors:** Working in the sun without head protection.
*   **Remedies:**
    *   **Sweet food:** Eat something sweet, like fruit or ice cream.
    *   **Nighttime Minimassage:** Before bed, rub bhringaraj oil or brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and scalp.
    *   **Cover your head:** Protect yourself from the sun.
    *   **Soothing Nose Drops:** Putting about 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee in each nostril will help relieve the pain.

**Kapha-type headache:**

*   **Characteristics:** Occurs in winter or spring, strikes in the morning or evening, and worsens when bending down. Often associated with sinus congestion, a clogged nose, a cold, or a cough.
*   **Remedies:**
    *   **Paste for Sinus Headaches:** Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon cinnamon and sufficient water, and apply it locally.
    *   **Saltwater Remedy:** Mix 1 teaspoon warm water and at least ⅛ teaspoon salt to make a thick, concentrated solution. Put 3 to 5 drops of this salt water in each nostril. This greatly helps to drain and unclog the sinuses and relieve the headache.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Avoid direct exposure to the sun:** If you do go out in the sun, wear a hat.
*   **Yoga:** Generally, a person having migraines should do the Moon Salutation. Helpful yoga postures include the Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, and Bow pose.
*   **Relax in a quiet, dark room.**

To give you more specific advice, could you tell me:

*   What time of year is it?
*   What time of day did the headache start?
*   Does bending over make it worse?
*   Do you have any sinus congestion or a cold?
*   Have you been under a lot of stress or feeling anxious lately?
*   Have you been constipated?
*   Have you been getting enough water?
